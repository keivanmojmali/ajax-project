**Beer Profile is a sign of the times. As more weekend nights are spent in, America turns to craft alcohol and home cooked meals. Beer Profile helps you explore craft beers of all varieties. Also, provides you with features that takes the stress out deciding what to drink and what foods would pair nicely with your alcohol. Beer Profile even offers specially curated five-beer flight sampler.**

### Main takeway from Beer Profile
* To prototype design but also pre-plan functions. Beer Profile was written using functional programming paradigm. 
Looking back, I can see that I could have planned pure functions from the start which would have dictated which features to
work on first. This would save me time on building out the code but also on debugging.
